# Possum-Regression
Predict the age of a possum 

Four different models of fully connceted neural networks have been created in TensorFlow. 

Preprocessing consists of the following stages:

- Standardization: converts all of your data to unit variance and 0 mean

- Normalization: A common practice when working with neural networks is to make sure all of the data you pass to them is in the range 0 to 1. 

- One-hot encoding to convert non-numerical data into numerics. 

Depending on the data, both normalization and standardization were tested to explore the best practice. 

Results have been compared in the last step.
